# Virtual Showroom with Godot

(Work in progress)

<img src="docs/screenshot1.jpg" width=600>
 
As an MVP developer, I've used Unity for many years, but there have been several challenges, such as the high licensing fees and the need for high-spec PCs.

In MVP development, high functionality isn't required; instead, low cost and quick turnaround are essential. I'm looking into Godot and would like to compare its low-cost and rapid development capabilities with Unity.

## Goal of this project

Remake the following project with Godot: https://github.com/araobp/virtual-showroom

## Code
