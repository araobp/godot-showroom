# Virtual Showroom with Godot

<img src="docs/screenshot1.jpg" width=600>
 
As an MVP developer for marketing DX, I've used Unity for many years, but there have been several challenges, such as the high licensing fees and the need for high-spec PCs.

In MVP development, high functionality isn't required; instead, low cost and quick turnaround are essential. I'm looking into Godot and would like to compare its low-cost and rapid development capabilities with Unity.

## Goal of this project

Remake the following project with Godot: https://github.com/araobp/virtual-showroom

## Projects

### Virtual Showroom with GenAI

I've confirmed that the Gemini API can be used from GDScript.

Note: "gemini_api_key_env.txt" file (Gemini API key value) is ignored by .gitignore.

### AI Robot with GenAI

## Other projects

### Physics test

=> [Code](/physics_test)

### Audio test

=> [Code](/audio_test)

### Mixamo test ([Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/))

I've confirmed that Mixamo models can be imported into Godot. Controlling animations from GDScript is also easy.

### MPFB test ([MPFB](https://static.makehumancommunity.org/mpfb.html))

It has been confirmed that models created with MPFB can be imported into Godot. Animation control from GDScript is also easy.

## Notes on MPFB

The eye shader generated by MPFB does not work with Godot, so I made this eye material:
