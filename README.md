(Work in progress)

As an MVP developer, I've used Unity for many years, but there have been several challenges, such as the high licensing fees and the need for high-spec PCs.

In MVP development, high functionality isn't required; instead, low cost and quick turnaround are essential. I'm looking into Godot and would like to compare its low-cost and rapid development capabilities with Unity.

## Goal of this project

Remake the following project with Godot: https://github.com/araobp/virtual-showroom

## Code

## Mixamo test ([Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/)}

I've confirmed that Mixamo models can be imported into Godot. Controlling animations from GDScript is also easy.

## MPFB test ([MPFB](https://static.makehumancommunity.org/mpfb.html))

It has been confirmed that models created with MPFB can be imported into Godot. Animation control from GDScript is also easy.

## Virtual Showroom with GenAI (Work in Progress)

I've confirmed that the Gemini API can be used from GDScript.

Note: "gemini_api_key_env.txt" file (Gemini API key value) is ignored by .gitignore.
